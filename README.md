# SpringTransactionExamples

This project are examples for the article _Transactions - A Spring Approach_. Java11 or higher is required and was built on SpringBoot 2.4.1 and SpringData 2.4.2. The database used was PostgreSQL 13.

To see the results, run the application. The log will show the behavior of each transaction. SpringData was configured with `ddl-auto = create`. Therefore, you should only have installed your database. If you have another database, change the property values `spring.jpa.database` and `spring.datasource.*` for your database.
